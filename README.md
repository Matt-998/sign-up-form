This is my sign up form project where i fiddled incessantly with CSS to get things looking perfect, however even still there are some slight issues but im choosing to accept it and move on with my life.

I was able to abuse CSS psuedo classes to get most of the form validation behavior i wanted and then finished it up with some JavaScript for the password validations.

During this project i was able to get some seat time with some basic form validation methods and styling as well as more practice wrestling with CSS layout.

Overall i'm happy with the result.
